# Security Improvements Documentation

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in the authentication system.

## Implemented Security Fixes

### 1. Server-Side Input Validation ✅
- Added Zod schemas for comprehensive input validation
- Sanitization of user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Strong password requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- Email format validation
- Name length and character validation

### 2. Rate Limiting ✅
- Implemented rate limiting for login and registration attempts
- Maximum 5 attempts per email address
- 15-minute lockout period after exceeding limit
- Separate rate limiting for login and registration
- In-memory storage (recommend Redis/database for production)

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling ✅
- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Proper error logging for debugging
- Sanitized error responses to clients
- Try-catch blocks for all authentication operations

### 4. Server-Side Redirects ✅
- Replaced client-side redirects with secure server-side redirects
- Prevents redirect manipulation attacks
- Uses Next.js `redirect()` function

### 5. Environment Security ✅
- Moved real credentials to `.env.example` template
- Replaced production credentials with placeholders in `.env.local`
- Added comments for proper credential setup

### 6. Password Security ✅
- Strong password requirements enforced
- Password confirmation validation
- Secure password handling (no sanitization of passwords)

## Setup Instructions

### Environment Configuration
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Replace placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

### Dependencies
The following packages were added for security:
- `zod`: Input validation and sanitization

## Security Features in Detail

### Input Validation Schema
- **Email**: Valid email format required
- **Password**: Minimum 8 characters, must contain:
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- **Name**: 2-50 characters, alphanumeric and spaces only

### Rate Limiting
- **Login**: 5 attempts per email per 15 minutes
- **Registration**: 5 attempts per email per 15 minutes
- **Lockout**: 15-minute cooldown period
- **Reset**: Successful authentication resets the counter

### Error Messages
- Generic messages prevent user enumeration
- Detailed errors logged server-side for debugging
- Rate limiting information provided to legitimate users

## Production Recommendations

1. **Rate Limiting Storage**: Replace in-memory storage with Redis or database
2. **HTTPS**: Ensure all traffic uses HTTPS in production
3. **CSRF Protection**: Consider implementing CSRF tokens for additional security
4. **Session Security**: Review session timeout and refresh policies
5. **Monitoring**: Implement security event logging and monitoring
6. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated for security patches

## Testing the Security Features

1. **Password Validation**: Try registering with weak passwords
2. **Rate Limiting**: Attempt multiple failed logins to trigger lockout
3. **Input Sanitization**: Test with malicious input strings
4. **Error Handling**: Verify generic error messages are returned

## Notes

- CSRF protection is marked as low priority since Next.js Server Actions have built-in CSRF protection
- The current implementation uses in-memory rate limiting suitable for development
- All security improvements maintain backward compatibility with existing UI components
